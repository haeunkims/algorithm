<h1> Pseudo Code </h1>
<p>Sort the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.</p>
<p>Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number</p>
<p>If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to the new 'minimum' and continue until the end of the array</p>
<p>If the minimum is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values</p>
<p>Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.</p>
