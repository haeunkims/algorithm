Sliding window - maxSubarraySum

Given an array of integers and a number, write a function called maxSubarraySum, which finds the maximum sum of a subarray with the length of the number passed to the function.

Not that the subarray but consist of a consecutive elements from the original array. In the first example [100,200,300] is a subarray of the original array, but [100,300] is not.

Examples.

maxSubarraySum([100,200,300,400],2) //700
maxSubarraySum([1,4,2,10,23,3,1,0,20],4) //39
