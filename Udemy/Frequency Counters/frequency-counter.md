Given two string, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letter of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.

Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
Time complexity- O(n)

Examples:
validAnagram(‘rat’,’car) //false
validAnagram(‘qwerty’,’qeywrt) // true
