<p>Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.</p>

<p>You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5</p>
<p>Output: 2</p>
