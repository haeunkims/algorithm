<p>You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.</p>
<p>Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: digits = [1,2,3]</p>
<p>Output: [1,2,4]</p>
<p>Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.</p>
<p>Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.</p>
<p>Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].</p>
