<p>Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].</p>
<p>The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.</p>
<p>You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]</p>
<p>Output: [24,12,8,6]</p>
